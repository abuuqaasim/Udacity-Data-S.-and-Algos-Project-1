Finding Files

For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with “.c"

There are two solutions to this problem in the code. The first uses recursion to traverse the file hierarchy tree while building a path. The second uses Python’s OS walk method to build a path. The OS walk method was also tested and verified, but its test output is not included. Since there are no limit to the depth of the subdirectories can be, a recursive solution seemed like the natural approach. To test the code a couple directories were created aside from the Udacity supplied directory. These directories are included in the submission folder.

Time complexity is O(#of terminal nodes in the file hierarchy tree) The space complexity is O(#of files with the desired extension)
